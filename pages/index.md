## {{ page.title }}

This is a repository for materials related to the BIO390 _Introduction to Bioinformatics_ lecture series at the University of ZÃ¼rich.

#### Time & Place

* 1 x 2h / week
* Tue 08:00-09:45
* UZH Irchel campus, **NEW Y15-G-60**

#### Course Language

* English

### 2020 COVID19 Regulations - On Site & Remote

Due to the limits imposed on on-site access, an "[On Site Reservation System](https://lms.uzh.ch/auth/RepositoryEntry/16814276758/CourseNode/102334338362995)"
has been established. It will allow a (rotating) set of students to attend the
lectures on Irchel. With the current numbers of registered students we expect to
be able to host ca. 50% per lecture on site.

Additional to this, remote options will be provided:

* lecture slides and tasks will be posted by the lecturers and linked from the
daily pages and/or deposited in OLAT
* podcasts will be made available (with delay)
* optional/possibly: live streaming

#### Summary

The handling and analysis of biological data using computational methods has become an essential part in most areas of biology. In this lecture, students will be introduced to the use of bioinformatics tools and methods in different topics, such as molecular resources and databases, standards and ontologies, sequence and high performance genome analysis, biological networks, molecular dynamics, proteomics, evolutionary biology and gene regulation. Additionally, the use of low level tools (e.g. Programming and scripting languages) and specialized applications will be demonstrated. Another topic will be the visualization of quantitative and qualitative biological data and analysis results.

#### Learning Goals

The overall learning goals - especially the (limited) set necessary for passing the test - will be updated throughout the semester.

This list is not exhaustive; additional information about "need to know" topics
will be provided during the individual lectures.
