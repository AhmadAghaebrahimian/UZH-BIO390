## {{page.title}}

This page indicates some of the learning goals, as emphasised by the different lecturers. Some points will have been discussed in different lectures; accordingly, exam questions may not refer to information of one specific presentation.

#### Bioinformatics: Definition & Concepts

* definition of "Bioinformatics" (cf. Anna Tramontano)
* categories of informatics tools used in bioinformatics
* hypothesis versus data driven science
* areas of bioinformatics/bioinformaticians, in contrast to ("pure" modelling, statistics etc.)
* 3 main categories of biological data, and example resources
* definition of API
* common sequence related file formats
* hierarchies and relationships as 2 main principles of ontologies
* areas of "not-bioinformatics", and why

#### Sequence Analysis

* substitution matrices
* BLAST

#### Statistical Bioinformatics

* statistical evidence for a change in the means
* usage of gene expression profiling
* dimensionality reduction
* central limit theorem
* multiple testing correction
* parameters for hierarchical clustering

#### Bioinformatics tools: Statistics & Graphics in R & BioConductor

* What is tidy data?
* ideas behind ggplot:  components of a ggplot, arrangement of input data ... (no actual code writing needed)
*  interpret common types of plots, e.g. barplot, boxplot, histogram
* effect of data transformation (e.g. log) on common types of plots

#### Regulatory Genomics and Epigenomics

* secondary/tertiary human genome structure
* functional genome content
* transcription factors & genome interaction
* chemical genome modifications, their effectors and results
* Chip-Seq

#### Metagenomics

* Students can explain the concept of taxonomic diversity
* Students can explain the concept microbial community dissimilarity
* Students know how sequences are used to derive an adopted species concept for prokaryotes
* Students are familiar with the principle steps for 16S rRNA-based taxonomic composition analysis
* Students can recapitulate the essential steps of short sequencing read assembly into contigs and scaffolds
* Students can describe the basic steps of metagenomic analysis: from raw reads to the reconstruction of genomic scaffolds

#### Proteomics

* principles of proteome organization in the cell
* key experimental and computational concepts  for the collection and analysis of high confidence protein-protein interaction data

#### Molecular Dynamics

* atomistic model 
* force field (potential energy function)
* treatment of solvent
* molecular dynamics (Newton equation of motion; Langevin equation)
* simulations of peptides and proteins
* statistical error and systematic error

#### Clinical Bioinformatics & Personalized Medicine

* genomic variants (types, numbers)
* genomic privacy and re-identification (concepts)
* Beacon example
* long range familial searches
* main bottlenecks of molecular diagnostics in the clinical setting
* goals of many personalized health initiatives
* direct-to-consumer genetic testing -> what, how
* currently favoured clinical NGS technology
* clinical trial participation

#### Text Mining

* text mining pipelines & (current) common programs/applications
* article/literature repositories (with focus on accessibility)
* processing steps in text mining
* common problems in text mining

#### Biological Networks

* Protein interaction and metabolic networks
* the two-hybrid assay and its limitations
* detection of protein complexes
* graphs, nodes, edges, paths
* geodesics, graph diameter
* common types of degree distributions
* adjacency matrix 
* shortest path matrix
* degree correlations
* assortative and disassortative graphs
* clustering coefficient
* community (module) detection
*  modularity Q
* Girvan-Newman algorithm
* cliques
* small world graphs
* motifs, graph representations of metabolic networks
* stoichiometry matrices
* null space
* flux balance analysis

#### Gene regulation and epigenetics

* read mapping
* peak calling
* sequence compression algorithms
